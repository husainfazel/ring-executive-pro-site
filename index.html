              The core game will always be free and available on Mac and Windows. There's no need to fiddling with settings to get a 20 year old game working. I wanted to modernize EWR and get rid of the clunky booking UI to create a game for the 2020s. Later down the line, there will be support for multiplayer and a mobile version of the game.

            <div class="px-4 pb-4">
              <p>Thank you, I've got some early feedback which suggests I'm on the right track and since this is a single person project, I definitely need all the help I can get with finishing the game. I'm getting to the point where having data (wrestlers, venues, staff members, titles etc) is really important. We're always in need of people to help us spread the word about the project - the more people get excited about the idea, the easier it is to be accountable to you guys and find pockets of free time to push the project forward. Please send me an email or join the Discord community to speak to me directly if you wish to help!</p>

            <summary class="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">What sets Ring Executive Pro apart from other wrestling simulation games? Can you name any other similar games?</summary>
            <div class="px-4 pb-4">
              <p>There are a ton of wrestling simulation games, EWR written by Adam Ryland as I've previously mentioned who has gone onto developer TEW. I realized that Promotion Wars by Adam Jennings is still around as well. Homeofprowrestling.info and bethebooker.com are good resources for finding out more. I think Ring Executive Pro is different to the other games because I wanted to focus on creating a game that did not look like a nerdy overblown spreadsheet or Microsoft Access project. Ring Executive Pro looks sexy and you feel immersed in the game (for example designing your title belts) when you play it. There's enough depth to the game to make it challenging and fun BUT I've created the UI in a way that you're not spending hours booking a show. As an adult, I don't have a huge amount of gaming time so I want the game to be fun for casual players as well as the hardcore fantasy bookers.</p>

            <summary class="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">What platforms / computers will Ring Executive Pro work on?</summary>
            <div class="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
              <p>Ring Executive Pro will work on all recent Windows and Mac based computers. I've kept the screen resolution fixed so older laptops can display it comfortably (making the entire UI responsive would be quite difficult at different resolutions so I opted for the fixed size) and I'm writing the code in an optimized manner so older machines can run it as well. My goal is to create a game that is snappy and lightweight, not a bloated resource guzzling app. As long as you can run cross platform apps written in Electron such as Spotify, Whatsapp, Discord etc - Ring Executive Pro should work on your computer as well.</p>

            <summary class="py-2 outline-none cursor-pointer focus:underline">Is Ring Executive Pro going to be free to play?</summary>
            <div class="px-4 pb-4 space-y-2">
              <p>Yes, I think charging for the game right now will be counter productive. EWR is as popular now because it was freeware and easily accessible to everyone. Longer term I would like to work on the project full time rather than contributing my free time towards it but I think there are lots of interesting ways to monetizing the game. I've thought about creating a mobile version of the game, charging for multiplayer mode and even having a subscription model where you can get updates on a regular basis to the base game. But for now, the only priority is to get the base game complete and available to the community for free so we can get the most people into our community as possible.</p>

              <p>Ring Executive Pro is built using Javascript and the Electron/React frameworks. The database is SQLite with API calls from the frontend made using RPC. I am hoping that it won't be too difficult to make a web version of the game or even a React Native based mobile version in the future.</p>
